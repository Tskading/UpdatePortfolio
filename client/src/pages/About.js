                  Full-Stack Web Developer embracing a passion for environmental
                  science and modern web technology to build a more accessible
                  understanding of the natural world. Collegiate background in utilizing Arc GIS in conjunction with water quality testing while holistically focused on earth science systems.  Currently leveraging my acquired knowledge in Full-Stack Web Development from the University of Washington, with modern technologies like JavaScript, NoSQL, React.js, and more.  My most recent project, SongBirdie, is a collaboration that allows you to have an online song journal at your side wherever you go - I really enjoy it. I have created a functional password generator, a daily planner, and also worked collaboratively to build a dynamic web-page utilizing JavaScript Ajax to provide multiple results for video game searches. I am equipped with managing complex challenges in a dynamic work environment to follow through with a formulated plan to drive success.
